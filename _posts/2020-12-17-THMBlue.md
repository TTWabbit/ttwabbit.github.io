## Recon

First step in this machine, using nmap to enumerate ports and services. In this case we use `nmap -sC -sV -oA file <targetIP>` so we use the default scripts, detect the version of the services, and write the results in a file in the three major formats.

![Nmap Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/blue/blue1.png "Nmap results")

With this we have the answer to the question 

<blockquote>How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?</blockquote>

To check the machine for vulnerabilities and answer the next question we use `nmap` with the `--scripts vuln` option. We find two vulnerabilities, one of them is a denial of service in remote desktop protocol, and the other one is what we are looking for.

## Gain Access

We are instructed to open metasploit and find the exploitation code for the vulnerability found in the previous question. To do that we run `msfconsole` and, once in metasploit we use `search` with the vulnerability name.

We type `use` with the route of the exploit, and then `options` to set the one required with `set`. With all configured we can `run` the exploit and we got a meterpreter session.

## Escalate

In our case we already have a meterpreter session, but we go through the steps anyway. The first question is easy to solve, more so using the hint. The required option is showed to us using `options` after we type `use` with the path from the previous question.

We `set` the required option and `run` the module. Then we select the session with  `sessions <number of session>`. To list the sessions, in case we are not sure which one is the one we want to interact with, we use the command `sessions`.

After running `getsystem`, we open a shell with the `shell` command and run `whoami` to verify we are NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

Then we are asked to run the `ps` command and find a process that is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. We migrate to this process with the `migrate <PID>` command.

## Cracking

To dump all of the password hashes of the machine we use the `hashdump` command. We find the name of the non-default user.

To crack the password we are going to use `John the Ripper` with the wordlist `rokcyou.txt` suggested as a hint. We also select the format for Windows hashes.

## Find Flags!

Now we go back to the meterpreter session to find the flags. To do that we use the `search -d / -f \*flag\*` command and `cat` to show them. We just need to paste the content of the found flags to finish the room.
