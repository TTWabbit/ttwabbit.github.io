## Pre-engagement Briefing

You have been assigned to a client that wants a penetration test conducted on an environment due to be released to production in three weeks.

Scope of work:

The client requests that an engineer conducts an external, web app, and internal assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test). The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of exploitation:

- user.txt
- root.txt

Additionally the client has provided the following scope allowances:

- Ensure that you modify your hosts file to reflect internal.thm.
- Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement.
- Locate and note all vulnerabilities found.
- Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard.
- Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope.

## Initial Enumeration

We add the domain `internal.thm` to the our `/etc/hosts` file and run the usual `nmap` scan.

![nmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/internal/int1.png)

The host seems to be running `Ubuntu`. We have two open ports:

- Port 22 OpenSSH 7.6p1
- Port 80 Apache 2.4.29

A `gobuster` scan of the web server gives us the next results:

![gobuster](../images/internal/int2.png)

And brute forcing directories from `/blog` we have:

![go2](../images/internal/int3.png)

We use `wp-scan` to analyze the `wordpress` site and we manage to brute-force the `/wp-login`

![wp credentials](../images/internal/int4.png)

To gain a shell on the system we use the usual `wordpress` process:

1. Go to appearance, theme editor.
2. Replace the 404 template with a php reverse shell code.
3. Navigate to a non-existent page on the website.

We obtain a shell as `www-data`

![shell](../images/internal/int5.png)

## Local Enumeration and Port Forwarding

The only user on the machine is `aubreanna`. We can't access the home directory. Performing a manual enumeration of the machine we found this credentials.

![credentials](../images/internal/int6.png)

With this credentials we can `ssh` to the machine and grab the user flag. Also there is a file `jenkins.txt` that reads

>internal jenkins service is running on 172.17.0.2:8080

To access that internal service from our machine we use `ssh tunneling`:

````shell
ssh -L 8080:172.17.0.2:8080 aubreanna@10.10.162.236
````

![port forwarding](../images/internal/int7.png)

Now if we navigate to `127.0.0.1:8080` we have access to the login page of the internal `jenkins` service. We don't have any credential for this service, and the default ones doesn't work. We capture a login request with `burpsuite` to form a `hydra` command to try to brute force the login. The command used is

````shell
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt localhost -s 8080 http-post-form "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&from=%2F&Submit=Sign+in:Invalid username or password"
````
And we have a hit

![hydra](../images/internal/int8.png)

Once we have access to `jenkins`, we go to `manage jenkins`, `script console` and use [this](https://gist.github.com/frohoff/fed1ffaab9b9beeb1c76) reverse shell to gain access as the `jenkins` .

![shell](../images/internal/int9.png)

## Privilege Escalation

Enumerating the system as `jenkins` we find this note in the `/opt` directory

![note.txt](../images/internal/int10.png)

And this credentials can be used to gain a shell as `root`.
