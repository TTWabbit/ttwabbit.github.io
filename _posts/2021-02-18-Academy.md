## Initial Shell Vulnerability Exploited

Access control vulnerability and CVE-2018-15133.

### Vulnerability Explanation

The access control vulnerability arises whenever the privileges of an user can be modified, allowing them to access to resources they are not intended to be able to. In this case the form in the `/register` page on the web server on port 80 uses a hidden input to establish the role of the user creating a account, allowing an attacker to create an account as administrator.

CVE-2018-15133 is a vulnerability in Laravel Framework (5.5.40 and 5.6x to 5.6.29) that leads to remote code execution if the attacker somehow knows the application key. The attack is based on an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value. 

### Vulnerability Fix

As we can read [here](https://hdivsecurity.com/owasp-broken-access-control).

>Access control is only effective if enforced in trusted server-side code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata.

Update Laravel Framework, the next versions of the framework patch the problem prohibiting deserialization operation on cookies or X-XSRF-TOKEN.

### Severity

High, CVSS3 score 8.1.

### Proof of Concept

First we register an account using the form in `/register` modifying the `roleid` value to be 1.

![register](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/academy/ac3.png)

With the credentials we use to register we can then access the `/admin.php` page and there we find

![admin.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/academy/ac4.png)

Adding the subdomain to our `/etc/hosts` file we can navigate to the developer page that discloses Laravel environment variables

![laravel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/academy/ac5.png)

With the `APP_KEY`  and using [this](https://github.com/aljavier/exploit_laravel_cve-2018-15133) exploit we gain a shell in the system. This shell is not persistent, every time we execute a command the deserialization process spawn a shell that dies after giving the response back. 

## Privilege Escalation

Enumerating the system we find this file with credentials

![credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/academy/ac6.png)

That password can be used in the `SSH` service, with the user `cry0l1t3`. This user is part of the group `adm` so we can read logs as him. We find this entry in audit logs

![logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/academy/ac7.png)

This log indicates that the user `mrb3n`tried to use the `su` command with the password of the field `data`that is `base64` encoded. Using `cyberchef` to decode it we got

![mrb3n](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/academy/ac8.png)

We can move to this other user with that password.

### Vulnerability Exploited

Misconfigured permissions in the `composer` binary.

### Vulnerability Explanation

The user `mrb3n` can run the binary `composer` as root without password, this allows the user to escalate privileges by crafting a `json` file that executes without dropping privileges.

![sudo -l](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/academy/ac9.png)

### Vulnerability Fix

Don't allow `composer` to be run as `sudo`, given that certain commands allow third party code to execute on the system. The [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-untrusted-packages-safely.md) itself warns the users about this.

### Severity

Critical

### Exploit Code

Following the steps from [this gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/composer/#sudo) entry we gain a `root` shell.
