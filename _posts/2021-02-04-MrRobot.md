## Initial Enumeration

An `nmap` scan reveals

![nmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/mrrobot/mrr1.png)

- Port 22 closed, ssh.
- Port 80 Apache http.
- Port 443 Apache https.

The web page of the server looks like this, really cool design.

Using the commands we can see some videos and images related to the Mr. Robot tv show. Running a `gobuster` scan yields the following results:

The `/robots` directory shows this two entries:

![robots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/mrrobot/mrr4.png)

One of the files is the first flag, the other one seems to be a list of passwords. On the `/license` directory we find a base64 encoded password.

![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/mrrobot/mrr6.png)

With this credentials we can access `/wp-admin`. Inside the wordpress control panel we find another user.

## Exploitation and Local Enumeration

We exploit wordpress as usual.

1. We grab a php reverse shell like [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php).
2. Go to appearance, editor, 404 template and paste the php shell code.
3. Start a nc listener.
4. Navigate to a 404 page.

We gain a shell as `daemon`

![shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/mrrobot/mrr8.png)

Only one user in the machine, `robot`. In his home folder we have two files

![home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/mrrobot/mrr9.png)

We can read the password file. First I tried to crack the `md5` hash with the `fsocity.dic` but not luck. Using rockyou and hashcat

````shell
hashcat --force -m 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
````
we manage to crack it and gain access as `robot`. We can now grab the second flag.

## Privilege Escalation

The `robot` user can't run sudo. Finding files with `SUID` bit set

````shell
find / -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
````

![suid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/mrrobot/mrr10.png)

`nmap` can be used to escalate privileges, according to [this entry](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#suid) of gtfobins.

![root](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TTWabbit/ttwabbit.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/mrrobot/mrr11.png)

And we can now read the 3rd flag.
